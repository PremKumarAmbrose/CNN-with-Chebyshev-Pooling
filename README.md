# CNN-with-Chebyshev-Pooling

A CNN  based image classifier in which an alternative layer for the Pooling is used, which is called Chebyshev Pooling layer.

The model which is quantized to "integer only" using tensorflowlite's post quantization can be deployed into STM32 microcontrollers family with the help of XCubeAI of STMicroelectronics.
